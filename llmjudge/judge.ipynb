      "Please act as an impartial judge and evaluate the quality of the responses provided by two AI assistants to the user question displayed below. Preferred responses should have point-by-point high-level explanations. You should choose the assistant that follows the user's instructions and answers the user's question better. Your evaluation should consider factors such as the helpfulness, relevance, accuracy, depth, creativity, and level of detail of their responses. Begin your evaluation by comparing the two responses and provide a short explanation. Avoid any position biases and ensure that the order in which the responses were presented does not influence your decision. Prefer answers that are more concise, more directly follow the instructions, and don't have additional content not related to the instructions. Do not favor certain names of the assistants. Be as objective as possible. After providing your explanation, output your final verdict by strictly following this format: \"[[A]]\" if assistant A is better, \"[[B]]\" if assistant B is better, and \"[[C]]\" for a tie.\n"

      "The code defines a function called `twoSum` that takes in two arguments: a list of integers `nums` and an integer `target`. The function returns a list of two integers representing the indices of the two numbers in the list that add up to the target. The function uses a dictionary `map` to store the indices of the numbers in the list. It then iterates through the list using the `enumerate` function to get both the index and the value of each number. For each number, it calculates the complement (i.e., the difference between the target and the number) and checks if the complement is already in the dictionary. If it is, the function returns the indices of the complement and the current number. If the complement is not in the dictionary, the function adds the current number and its index to the dictionary. If the function completes the loop without finding a pair of numbers that add up to the target, it returns an empty list.\n",

      "The code defines a function called `twoSum` that takes in two arguments: a list of integers `nums` and an integer `target`. The function returns a list of two integers representing the indices of the two numbers in the list that add up to the target.

It then iterates through the list using the `enumerate` function to get both the index and the value of each number.

      "The code defines a function called `twoSum` that takes in two arguments: a list of integers `nums` and an integer `target`. The function returns a list of two integers representing the indices of the two numbers in the list that add up to the target.

It then iterates through the list using the `enumerate` function to get both the index and the value of each number.

      "The code defines a function called `twoSum` that takes in two arguments: a list of integers `nums` and an integer `target`. The function returns a list of two integers representing the indices of the two numbers in the list that add up to the target. The function uses a dictionary `map` to store the indices of the numbers in the list. It then iterates through the list using the `enumerate` function to get both the index and the value of each number. For each number, it calculates the complement (i.e., the difference between the target and the number) and checks if the complement is already in the dictionary. If it is, the function returns the indices of the complement and the current number. If the complement is not in the dictionary, the function adds the current number and its index to the dictionary. If the function completes the loop without finding a pair of numbers that add up to the target, it returns an empty list.\n",

      "The code defines a function called `twoSum` that takes in two arguments: a list of integers `nums` and an integer `target`. The function returns a list of two integers representing the indices of the two numbers in the list that add up to the target. The function uses a dictionary `map` to store the indices of the numbers in the list. It then iterates through the list using the `enumerate` function to get both the index and the value of each number. For each number, it calculates the complement (i.e., the difference between the target and the number) and checks if the complement is already in the dictionary. If it is, the function returns the indices of the complement and the current number. If the complement is not in the dictionary, the function adds the current number and its index to the dictionary. If the function completes the loop without finding a pair of numbers that add up to the target, it returns an empty list.\n",
